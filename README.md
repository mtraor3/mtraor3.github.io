### Portfolio Section

* Accessible via the Navbar

The "Portfolio" section showcases the owner's projects. It is viewed within a popup modal when the site visitor selects "Portfolio" in the navbar. Each project within the modal is represented by a card, and all projects are contained in sections (e.g "Computer Vision", "LLMs", etc). Each card includes a title, description, and a link to the project's GitHub repository. The projects are displayed in a grid layout.

### Contact Section

* Accessible via the Navbar (click "Contact").

The "Contact" section is a popup modal that includes a short message and allows site visitors to find the site owner on various social sites. The social sites provide areas for the site owner to be "followed", "connected with", or contacted.

Further customizations can be made by site owners such as including or embedding contact forms. If the webpage code will all be public, be sure to use a service that does not require an email (or other private information), secret key or API key to be included in the public code.
